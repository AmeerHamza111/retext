The [**retext**][retext] processor is a natural language processor
powered by [plug-ins][plugins].

*   Interface by [**unified**][unified]
*   [**nlcst**][nlcst] syntax tree
*   Parses natural language to the tree with [**retext-latin**][latin]
*   [Plug-ins][plugins] transform the tree
*   Compiles the tree to text using [**retext-stringify**][stringify]

Don‚Äôt need the parser, or another parser?  [That‚Äôs OK][unified-usage].

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install retext
```

## Usage

```js
var retext = require('retext');
var profanities = require('retext-profanities');
var emoji = require('retext-emoji');
var report = require('vfile-reporter');

retext()
  .use(profanities)
  .use(emoji, {convert: 'encode'})
  .process('He‚Äôs set on beating your butt for sheriff! :cop:', function (err, file) {
    console.log(String(file));
    console.error(report(err || file));
  });
```

Yields:

```txt
He‚Äôs set on beating your butt for sheriff! üëÆ
  1:26-1:30  warning  Be careful with ‚Äúbutt‚Äù, it‚Äôs profane in some cases  butt  retext-profanities
